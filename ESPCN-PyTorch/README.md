### About Real-Time Single Image and Video Super-Resolution Using an Efficient Sub-Pixel Convolutional Neural Network.

If you're new to ESPCN, here's an abstract straight from the paper:

Recently, several models based on deep neural networks have achieved great success in terms of both reconstruction 
accuracy and computational performance for single image super-resolution. In these methods, the low resolution (LR) 
input image is upscaled to the high resolution (HR) space using a single filter, commonly bicubic interpolation, 
before reconstruction. This means that the super-resolution (SR) operation is performed in HR space. We demonstrate 
that this is sub-optimal and adds computational complexity. In this paper, we present the first convolutional neural 
network (CNN) capable of real-time SR of 1080p videos on a single K2 GPU. To achieve this, we propose a novel CNN 
architecture where the feature maps are extracted in the LR space. In addition, we introduce an efficient 
sub-pixel convolution layer which learns an array of upscaling filters to upscale the final LR feature maps into 
the HR output. By doing so, we effectively replace the handcrafted bicubic filter in the SR pipeline with more 
complex upscaling filters specifically trained for each feature map, whilst also reducing the computational complexity 
of the overall SR operation. We evaluate the proposed approach using images and videos from publicly available datasets 
and show that it performs significantly better (+0.15dB on Images and +0.39dB on Videos) and is an order of magnitude 
faster than previous CNN-based methods.
